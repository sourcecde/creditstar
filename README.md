#Test exercise for Creditstar Group

As a very first shortlisting procedure of candidates, we have set up a test exercise that the interested applicants are executing.  

We assume that interested applicants would be able to complete the test within a few days. 

Once the test is completed please forward the results to <it.career@creditstar.com>.

## Setup

Install Docker https://www.docker.com/get-started

Update your vendor packages

    docker-compose run --rm php composer update --prefer-dist
    
Run the installation triggers (creating cookie validation code)

    docker-compose run --rm php composer install    
    
Start the container

    docker-compose up -d
    
Run database migration (creating tables)

    docker-compose run --rm php yii migrate    
    docker-compose run --rm php tests/bin/yii migrate    
        
You can then access the application through the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Database

The database consists of two tables created for you ```loan``` and ```user```. Each User can have multiple Loans. Each loan must have a User.

## Assignment

You need to create a webapp that provides:

1.  Viewing, adding, editing and removing Loans and Users in the database. User's input must be validated.
    * https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/start-forms
    * https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/input-forms

2.  Listing out all the Loans and Users (pagination, filtering, and sorting).
    * https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/output-data-providers
    * https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/output-data-widgets

3.  There are two JSON files in the root folder of the project ( ```users.json``` and ```loans.json``` ) with predefined loans and users. 

    You must import that data into the database programmatically. For example, create a [console script](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/tutorial-console) that imports the file or use a [migration](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/db-migrations)

4.  Write a method to get user age from user personal code. 
    
    All supplied personal codes are in [Estonian personal code format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number#Estonia).
    Display user age in user view.

5.  Style of the page should be based on ```recruitment.png``` file that is included with the project under root.

    Use Bootstrap available functionalities as much as you can. Bonus for responsiveness ( rather mandatory ) and SCSS usage. [Ubuntu font](http://font.ubuntu.com) should be used.

6.  Write a test case to test if your user age calculation method returns correct age and test if user is allowed to apply for a loan (user is not underage).

    Run this command to execute tests:

        docker-compose run --rm php codecept run
    
**Once the assignment is done upload to a public git repository (github, bitbucket)**

## Evaluation Criteria

*  Is every feature working
*  Use as much [Yii 2](https://www.yiiframework.com) built-in features. For layout use Bootstrap which comes with Yii2 OOTB (feel free to use Foundation 6 instead of Bootstrap)
*  MVC usage
*  Using models ( keyword here is Yii's built-in tool Gii for creating them from database tables), views and controllers correctly.
    *  http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/ext-gii-index.html
    *  http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-structure-overview.html
   
*  Code legibility
*  Git usage. How commits are created and commented. We want to see the process of the work
*  Finished code should be possible to deploy and run the same way as described in Setup section
